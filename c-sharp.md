# Introduction 
this tutorial is meant to start you on the long journey of becoming a programmer, while i hope that it will take you a long way. Know that only through practice and good habits can we become a good programmer. In this article we'll be going through c# and it's convention. 


## Your best friends
Every programmer should know these platforms:
- google (or the search engine of your choice)
- stackoverflow (should be the top results of any good programming google search)
- IDE's (to each there own but for c# i recommend visual studio)
### google
### stackoverFlow 
this website is where you will find all the answers to your problems (at least in the begining), it's important to remember not to try to reinvent the wheel.
### IDE's
this is where you should write your code and in the case of visual studio it's where you run it as well.


## What is programming 
The art of programing is the knowledge of having a computer do what you want, inorder to be able to that you should first understand what a computer can do. the first thing you should understand is that a computer can't read your mind, so make sure what you write is what you want to happen. Now computers only know machine code which is iledgible for humans, that's the reason for the invetion of coding languages like c# which are compiled into machine code.
